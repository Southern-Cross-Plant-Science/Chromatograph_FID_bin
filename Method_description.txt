I may have a solution in place. Attached is the excel file that bins each timepoint x measurements made, in serial and matrix format. The general flow for data preparation I made are the following:

1.	Make a  consensus timepoint vector for all samples . In your case, the 519 timepoints x  samples became 373 timepoints across all samples. Pls see the <consense_timepoints> sheet.
2.	I binned the timepoints according to the difference of the next timepoint with the current timepoint, this is where I chose a fixed arbitrary difference, based on how the consensus timepoints data looked like. I chose the difference of 0.005 for now, though this can be adjusted easily since I developed a script for this. So, for example, starting with timepoint 1, if the difference with next timepoint is < = 0.005, I assigned them to the same bin number, then so on. If the difference becomes > 0.005, I assign the next timepoint to then next bin number. Pls see the <timeBins_g005> sheet. There are 90 bins across the 10 samples now, indicating the start time and end time for each bin. If we use a lower difference (e.g 0.003), then we expect more bins.
3.	I then recreated your original table, adding the <BinNumber> column, since the timepoint will either fall within a bin or will be absent in a bin, this serial form (all samples IDs are in the same column, all measurements available in columns too) is available in < SerialSample_binned_g005 > sheet. I think for stat software, the serial format can be used easily.

You can now group across samples by using the bin number, since the same bin number across samples appear. Even if timepoints are slightly different across samples, they are assigned to the same bin.
4.	The matrix form is also given (samples are in different columns in < Matrix_Area_Sample_X_bin_g005> sheet, then I just displayed the area measurement for each sample and bin for simplicity. I can make tables for the other measurements as well, since I have this in a database already.
